Recommendation systems are essential for delivering customized content in domains such as social networking, entertainment, and e-commerce. In particular, movie recommendation systems are essential for improving user experience by making pertinent film recommendations based on user preferences and historical behavior. The goal of this study is to balance accuracy and computational efficiency by examining the performance of both sophisticated deep learning (DL) and conventional machine learning (ML) models for movie suggestions. The project analyzes four models—KNNWithMeans, SVD, Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), and the Transformer Model—that are selected to reflect both traditional ML approaches and contemporary DL architectures using a well-known dataset of user-movie interactions. An 80:20 train-test split was used to train the models after the dataset was preprocessed by encoding movie genres using one-hot vectors. Metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and training time were used to assess the models. Although KNNWithMeans had the quickest training time (0.56 seconds), its accuracy was lower, as seen by its greatest MAE of 0.695. In contrast, the SVD model, which had an MSE of 0.753, RMSE of 0.868, and MAE of 0.666, demonstrated a balance between accuracy and computing efficiency. Superior accuracy was shown by deep learning models such as Transformer and NCF; the Transformer model achieved an MSE of 0.835 and an MAE of 0.686, but at the expense of a noticeably longer training time (92.82 seconds). With a training time of 35.99 seconds and an MAE of 0.694, the NCF model likewise demonstrated remarkable accuracy. These findings demonstrate the trade-off between computing demands and accuracy. Despite their increased accuracy, deep learning models are computationally demanding and less useful for resource-constrained real-time applications. The significance of choosing the right model based on particular use case requirements and available computing power is emphasized by this effort. In order to improve accuracy and efficiency, future research should investigate hybrid models that combine the best features of ML and DL approaches.
